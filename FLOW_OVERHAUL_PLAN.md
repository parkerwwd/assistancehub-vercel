# Lead Flow System Overhaul Plan

## 🎯 Strategic Decision: Unified JSON Payload Architecture

### Why JSON Payload Over Relational?
1. **Already 70% implemented** - FlowPayload + FlowService + versioning exists
2. **Better performance** - Single query vs complex joins
3. **Flexible for complex logic** - Conditional rules, A/B testing
4. **Version control built-in** - Draft/publish workflows
5. **Future-proof** - Easier to add new step types

## 📐 New Unified Architecture

### Core Tables (Simplified)
```sql
-- Primary flow metadata
flows (id, name, slug, status, created_at, updated_at)

-- Versioned flow definitions (JSON payload)
flow_versions (id, flow_id, version, status, payload, created_at)

-- Audit trail
flow_audit (id, flow_id, action, version, created_at, performed_by)

-- Lead capture (unchanged)
leads (id, flow_id, responses, created_at)
```

### Enhanced FlowPayload Schema
```typescript
interface FlowPayload {
  id?: string;
  name: string;
  slug: string;
  description?: string;
  status: 'draft' | 'active' | 'paused' | 'archived';
  
  // Validated configurations
  settings: FlowSettings;
  style_config: StyleConfig;
  google_ads_config: GoogleAdsConfig;
  
  // Steps with full type safety
  steps: FlowStep[];
  
  // Logic rules (conditional, A/B testing)
  logic: LogicRule[];
  
  // Metadata
  metadata: FlowMetadata;
}
```

## 🛠️ Technical Improvements

### Type Safety Enhancements
- Remove all `as any` casting
- Strict Zod validation for all configurations
- Runtime type guards for flow data
- Proper TypeScript interfaces

### Performance Optimizations
- Single query flow loading
- Cached flow resolution
- Optimized payload structure
- Better error boundaries

### Developer Experience
- Clear migration path
- Better error messages
- Simplified APIs
- Comprehensive testing

## 🗂️ Legacy System Deprecation

### Tables to Deprecate
- `flow_steps` (replaced by FlowPayload.steps)
- `flow_fields` (replaced by FlowPayload.steps[].fields)

### Components to Refactor
- `OptInFlowWizard` → Integrate into unified creator
- `FlowEditor` → Remove type casting, use FlowService
- `FlowRenderer` → Simplified payload loading

### Migration Strategy
1. **Parallel systems** during transition
2. **Gradual migration** of existing flows
3. **Fallback support** for legacy data
4. **Clean deprecation** after validation

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Code Quality
- Zero `as any` casting in flow system
- 100% TypeScript coverage
- Runtime validation for all flow data

### Developer Experience  
- Single flow creation interface
- Clear error messages
- Simplified debugging

### System Reliability
- Consistent data structure
- Proper version control
- Robust fallback mechanisms
